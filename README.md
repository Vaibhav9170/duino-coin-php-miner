# Duino Coin - PHP Miner
This is a proof of concept.
This miner is provided as is, with no guarantee it will work as intended for you.
I don't intend to actively maintain this miner.
I'm also not responsible for how you use it.

## Why did you do it?
I only made this to have some fun and to prove that [PHP 8 is indeed faster than python](https://scand.com/company/blog/php-vs-python/#:~:text=Some%20years%20ago%2C%20Python%20was,speed%20may%20greatly%20improve%20performance.).

For sure there are a lot of room for improvements such as spawning multiple async threads (either in the guessing algorithm or multiple instances) to make use of multi-processors. However, I don't intend to do it for the sake of simplicity.
